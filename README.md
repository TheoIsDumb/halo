an attempt at trying to make a JioSaavn frontend with Tkinter.  
just dead-simple search-n-play, no fancy things.  
idk i don't wanna fire up a whole browser and youtube music just to listen to one song.

 ### what it can do
 
 - search for music
 - play a track
 - play/pause
 - seek
 
### what it can't do

- loop
- play next song automatically
- playlist functionality
- lyrics
- albums, artists, playlists, radio
- everything else (bruh)

NB: might not work outside india, because jiosaavn api.
